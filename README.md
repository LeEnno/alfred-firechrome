Alfred Workflow to open Chrome's current tab in Firefox by using `ff` keyword. If Firefox is currently active then it works in reverse, i.e. it'll open Firefox's current tab in Chrome.

I use it in webdevelopment to check if a website is looking good in Firefox.

You can also use the keyword 'iff' to open the currently open Chrome tab in Firefox's Private Browsing mode. If Firefox is your currently active window, it'll open a new Chrome window in Incognito mode.

Usage
-----

1. Open a URL in Chrome or Firefox
2. Trigger Alfred (normally ‚å•Space)
3. Type `ff` and Enter.

Notes
-----

You can also start typing `Firechrome` as a whole word if you struggle with memorizing the short keyword. Alfred should show it as a result which you can select.

If you don't like `ff` as hotkey, change it to what you like by double clciking the corresponding pane in Alfred's Workflow section. This applies to other keywords as well. Refer to the screenshot below.
