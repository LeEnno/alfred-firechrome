Alfred Workflow to open Chrome's current tab in Firefox by using `ff` keyword.

I use it in webdevelopment to check if a website is looking good in Firefox.

If you use Firefox as your primary browser, you can use the 'krome' keyword to open it in Chrome.

You can also use the keyword 'incognito' to open the currently open Chrome tab in Incognito mode. The same action is also bound to the keyboard shortcut Shift+Comannd+M.

Usage
-----

1. Open a URL in Chrome
2. Trigger Alfred (normally ‚å•Space)
3. Type `ff` and Enter.

Notes
-----

You can also start typing `Firechrome` as a whole word if you struggle with memorizing the short keyword. Alfred should show it as a result which you can select.

If you don't like `ff` as hotkey, change it to what you like by double clciking the corresponding pane in Alfred's Workflow section. This applies to other keywords as well. Refer to the screenshot below.
