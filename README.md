=================

Alfred Workflow to open Chrome's current tab in Firefox by using `ff` keyword.

I use it in webdevelopment to check if a website is looking good in Firefox.

Usage
-----

1. Open a URL in Chrome
2. Trigger Alfred (normally ‚å•Space)
3. Type `ff` and Enter.

Notes
-----

You can also start typing `Firechrome` as a whole word if you struggle with memorizing the short keyword. Alfred should show it as a result which you can select.

If you don't like `ff` as hotkey, change it to what you like by double clciking the corresponding pane in Alfred's Workflow section. Refer to the screenshot below.
